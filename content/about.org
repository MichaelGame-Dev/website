## What is Development With Michael all about?
This is a site serves a few functions:

 1. To allow me to showcase my games (especially Radiant Bricks!) and other programming projects
 2. To post thoughts about things I learn in programming or areas where I've found difficulty
 3. Occasionally posting something more of a tutorial or cookbook style post to share some of the knowledge I've gained.
